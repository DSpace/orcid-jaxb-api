# ORCID API (generated by JAXB)

This is an ORCID-Model Java API generated (using JAXB) from the official ORCID XSDs.

Resources:
* ORCID-Model Official XSDs: https://github.com/ORCID/orcid-model/tree/master/src/main/resources

:warning: WARNING: GENERATED SOURCE CODE

All source code in `src/main/java/` has been auto-generated (by JAXB) via the official ORCID.org XSDs.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This source code has only been tested with DSpace and may or may not work for other ORCID use cases.

## How to (re)generate ORCID Java API

The below will regenerate/update the ORCID Java API stored in the `src/main/java` folder of this GitHub repo.

1. Clone this `orcid-jaxb-api` repo locally
2. Clone the [ORCID-model](https://github.com/ORCID/orcid-model/) repo (to a different location), and optionally checkout a specific tag:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ORCID/orcid-model.git
   ```
3. Copy the necessary ORCID XSD folders into this repo's `src/main/resources/xsd/` folder. Check the POM `<schemaIncludes>` list for the XSDs we need.
  _Be sure not to overwrite the `.gitignore` already in the "empty" `xsd` folder, as we do NOT want to keep the XSDs in this repo!_
   ```
   # Copy over common XSDs
   cp -r [ORCID-model]/src/main/resources/common_3.0 [orcid-jaxb-api]/src/main/resources/xsd/
   
   # Copy over record XSDs
   cp -r [ORCID-model]/src/main/resources/record_3.0 [orcid-jaxb-api]/src/main/resources/xsd/
   ```
4. Build project (with profile `generate-sources-from-jaxb` enabled)
   ```
   cd [orcid-jaxb-api]
   
   # WARNING This next line overwrites Java source in ./src/main/java/
   mvn -U clean package -Pgenerate-sources-from-jaxb
   ```
5. Double check the source code generated. If any class names or package names need to be updated, you may need to modify our custom [`orcid-3.0.xjb`](https://github.com/DSpace/orcid-jaxb-api/blob/master/src/main/resources/binding/orcid-3.0.xjb), as this is the JAXB Binding file used in the code generation process.
    1. Keep an eye out especially for any source code generated under an `ns` package path, as this means a specific XSD was not assigned a package name.
6. If everything looks good, create a PR, noting which version of the ORCID XSDs you used to update the Java source code (e.g. either a specific release number or `master` of a given date)
   
## Build Project

**The project requires JAVA 6-8 to build**. After regenerating the ORCID Java API (using JAXB and ORCID's XSDs -- see above), you can easily build this project by just running:

```
mvn -U clean package
```

The result will be a `./target/orcid-jaxb-api-[version].jar`


## License

The project retains the [ORCID MIT-Style license](https://github.com/DSpace/orcid-jaxb-api/blob/master/LICENSE), as all code within it is automatically generated from ORCID's XSDs.
